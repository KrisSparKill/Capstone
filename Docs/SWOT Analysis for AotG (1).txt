In each of the below categories, list out the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats you see for your application:  
(Example of a threat would be competition from similar applications BUT your strength would be how your application is different or better than the competition.)  


LIST A MINIMUM OF 3 ITEMS IN EACH CATEGORY
 (This is based on research you have completed for your application.) 


S
Strengths 
* Nothing like this exists on the market currently as an all-in-one package
* Streamlines workflow for Travel Advisors
* Makes it easier for clients to have access to excursions
* Allows clients and travel advisors to work together at anytime
* Clients will click on one link vs. searching through several links to find what they want


	W
Weakness
* There are a lot of excursions/activities across the world (takes time to compile), lots of cruise ships and destinations
* There are a lot of travel agencies that could use this as well and that would take time compiling the information just for them
* All the content exists already and people are used to getting it from the various websites
* It uses data from other websites so if one goes down, it could possibly affect ours




	O
Opportunities 
* To simplify processes between travel advisors and clients
* To build a bridge between suppliers and travel advisors to allow for both to profit more 
* To have all available excursions/tours/activities in one place
* To bring something unique to the travel advisor/client relationship


	T
Threats 
* Tour operators not keeping inventory up to date
* Tour operators removing “affiliate” access to advisors
* Similar threats that all websites face: hacking, code degeneration, etc…
* The ever changing areas (businesses moving, buildings being torn down or built, ships being sold/scrapped, etc)
